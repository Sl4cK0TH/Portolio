        "bio": "Hi, I am Van, a 24 years old located in Odiongan, Romblon, Philippines. My interest has always been in Cyber Security. I want to ensure that security is our top priority within our quickly developing world and would like to contribute to a more secure environment.\n\nI like to keep myself relevant by solving Capture The Flags and following the latest IT developments that's why I always participate in any online CTF events. I also keep myself busy by listening to programming, creating CTF challenges and listening to podcasts like Darknet Diaries. I would like to improve myself within the Cybersecurity field in order to become a Cybersecurity expert both on Red Teaming and Blue Teaming. I always keep a close eye to newly discovered vulnerabilities and like to challenge myself with unsolved weaknesses. I am someone who wants to make the world a more secure place for the next generation, even if it goes unnoticed.",
